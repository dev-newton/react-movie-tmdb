# Project Overview

Take Home: Main Discovery Screen and a Details View
In this stage youâ€™ll build the core experience of your movies app. 
Your app will:
On the first load, present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters.
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional
information such as:
original title
movie poster image thumbnail
A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
user rating (called vote_average in the api)
release date
